# 🧾 Receipt Forgery Detection (with Explainable AI)

🚀 **AI-powered web app** that detects whether a receipt is **genuine** or **forged** using a deep learning model (ResNet50).  
Built with **PyTorch, Streamlit, and Grad-CAM** for full transparency and explainability.  

---

## ✨ Features
✅ **AI Model:** ResNet50 CNN (high accuracy, trained on custom dataset)  
✅ **Explainable AI:** Grad-CAM heatmaps highlight which parts of the receipt the model used  
✅ **Confidence Gauge:** Shows how sure the model is (green = genuine, red = forged)  
✅ **Interactive UI:** Clean, minimal Streamlit interface with dark/light theme  
✅ **Deployable Anywhere:** One-click deployment on Streamlit Cloud
